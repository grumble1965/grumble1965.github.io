  <h1>Kelly Hall</h1>
  <p>I write software, design hardware, play with radios, and do various other geeky things. This page describes some
    of them.</p>

    <h2>Coding Projects</h2>
    <p>I have projects for whatever catches my fancy. Some of these are stored on Github. Anything I put here is free
      for anyone to use.</p>

    <table>

        <th>Repo</th>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><a href="https://github.com/grumble1965/PythonMiser">PythonMiser</a></td>
        <td>A python conversion of a Commodore PET basic game from 1980. I wanted to play with TDD, and my friend wanted
          to play the game that was too big for his 8K PET back in the day.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><a href="https://github.com/grumble1965/synacor-challenge">Synacor Challenge</a></td>
        <td>A fun programming challenge. Not much hand-holding, but not bad.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</td>
        <td>An annual coding game for the month of December. It goes from fairly easy to stinking hard. This should be
          one
          repo, but for now it's <a href="https://github.com/grumble1965/advent2015">2015</a>, <a
            href="https://github.com/grumble1965/advent2016">2016</a>, <a
            href="https://github.com/grumble1965/advent2018">2018</a>, and <a

    <h2>Amateur Radio</h2>
    <p>I hold a Technician license with station ID <i>KJ6WUW</i> and I'm located in grid <i>DN18LE</i>. I rarely do
      voice,
      but enjoy DX and Packet (really). </p>
    <p>Why just a Tech license? Because I think the cool radio stuff these days starts at VHF and goes up. Tech gives me
      access to all that spectrum with a minimum of fuss and without massive antennas. That said, I like to monitor HF
      ACARS, local government, and SW.
