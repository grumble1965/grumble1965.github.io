  <h1>Kelly Hall</h1>
  <p>I write software, design hardware, play with radios, and do various other geeky things. This page describes some
    of them.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p>I'll likely put a work history in here at some point. I've worked coding, EE, team management, project maagement,
      systems engineering (HW/SW architecture, interfaces, test plans), in ecommerce, embedded systems, medical, energy
      (aka oil), computer security, defense, and radio/satellite communications.</p>

    <h2>Coding Projects</h2>
    <p>I have projects for whatever catches my fancy. Some of these are stored on Github. Anything I put here is free
      for anyone to use.</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Repo</th>
        <th>Project Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><a href="https://github.com/grumble1965/PythonMiser">PythonMiser</a></td>
        <td>A python conversion of a Commodore PET basic game from 1980. I wanted to play with TDD in Python, and my
          friend wanted to play the game that was too big for his 8K PET back in the day.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><a href="https://github.com/grumble1965/synacor-challenge">Synacor Challenge</a></td>
        <td>A fun programming challenge. Not much hand-holding, but not bad.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</td>
        <td>An annual coding game for the month of December. It goes from fairly easy to stinking hard. This should be
          one
          repo, but for now it's <a href="https://github.com/grumble1965/advent2015">2015</a>, <a
            href="https://github.com/grumble1965/advent2016">2016</a>, <a

          into Rust.

    <h2>Amateur Radio</h2>
    <p>I hold an FCC amateur radio Technician license with station ID <a
        href="https://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/license.jsp?licKey=3380549">KJ6WUW</a> and I'm located in grid
      <a href="https://www.karhukoti.com/maidenhead-grid-square-locator/?grid=DN18LE">DN18LE</a>. I rarely do voice, but
      enjoy DX listening and packet (really - it's fun to route like it's 1985).
    </p>
    <p>Why just a Tech license? Because I think the cool radio stuff these days starts at VHF and goes up. Tech gives me
      access to all that spectrum with a minimum of fuss and without massive antennas. That said, I like to monitor HF
      ACARS, local government, and SW.
    </p>
    <p>Equipment: Icom IC-92AD, Kenwood TH-D72, and a handful of SDR dongles (AirSpy, FunCube, etc.).</p>

    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <p>I've always played games on computers, to the point that I've sold my machines because gaming took up too much
      time in my life. (I'm looking at you, XWing; I liked that 386SX). Expect a list at some point.</p>
