  <h1>Kelly Hall</h1>
  <p>I write software, design hardware, play with radios, and do various other geeky things. This page describes some
    of them.</p>

  <h2>Coding Projects</h2>
  <p>I have projects for whatever catches my fancy. Some of these are stored on Github. Anything I put here is free for
    anyone to use.</p>
